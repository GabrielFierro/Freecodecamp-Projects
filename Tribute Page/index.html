        <h1>Here's a time line of Alan's life</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Born Alan Mathison Turing 23 June 1912.</li>
          <li>
            Between January 1922 and 1926, Turing was educated at Hazelhurst
            Preparatory School, an independent school in the village of Frant in
            Sussex (now East Sussex).
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1928, aged 16, Turing encountered Albert Einstein's work; not
            only did he grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce
            Einstein's questioning of Newton's laws of motion from a text in
            which this was never made explicit.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at King's
            College, Cambridge,[7] where he was awarded first-class honours in
            mathematics.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1935, at the age of 22, he was elected a Fellow of King's College
            on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the central
            limit theorem.
          </li>
          <li>
            From September 1936 to July 1938, Turing spent most of his time
            studying under Church at Princeton University,[4] in the second year
            as a Jane Eliza Procter Visiting Fellow. In addition to his purely
            mathematical work, he studied cryptology and also built three of
            four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier.
          </li>
          <li>
            From September 1938, Turing worked part-time with the Government
            Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), the British codebreaking
            organisation. He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma cipher
            machine used by Nazi Germany, together with Dilly Knox, a senior
            GC&CS codebreaker.
          </li>
          <li>
            On 4 September 1939, the day after the UK declared war on Germany,
            Turing reported to Bletchley Park, the wartime station of GC&CS.[66]
            Specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical
            advances that Turing made during the war.
          </li>
          <li>
            Within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park,[66] Turing had specified
            an electromechanical machine called the bombe, which could break
            Enigma more effectively than the Polish bomba kryptologiczna, from
            which its name was derived. The bombe, with an enhancement suggested
            by mathematician Gordon Welchman, became one of the primary tools,
            and the major automated one, used to attack Enigma-enciphered
            messages.
          </li>
          <li>
            The bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out
            that setting, moving on to the next. Most of the possible settings
            would cause contradictions and be discarded, leaving only a few to
            be investigated in detail. A contradiction would occur when an
            enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext
            letter, which was impossible with the Enigma. The first bombe was
            installed on 18 March 1940.
          </li>
          <li>
            By late 1941, Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman,
            Hugh Alexander and Stuart Milner-Barry were frustrated. Building on
            the work of the Poles, they had set up a good working system for
            decrypting Enigma signals, but their limited staff and bombes meant
            they could not translate all the signals. In the summer, they had
            considerable success, and shipping losses had fallen to under
            100,000 tons a month; however, they badly needed more resources to
            keep abreast of German adjustments. They had tried to get more
            people and fund more bombes through the proper channels, but had
            failed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Between 1945 and 1947, Turing lived in Hampton, London,[108] while
            he worked on the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) at
            the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). He presented a paper on 19
            February 1946, which was the first detailed design of a
            stored-program computer.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1948, Turing was appointed reader in the Mathematics Department
            at the Victoria University of Manchester. A year later, he became
            Deputy Director of the Computing Machine Laboratory, where he worked
            on software for one of the earliest stored-program computersâ€”the
            Manchester Mark 1. Turing wrote the first version of the
            Programmer's Manual for this machine, and was recruited by Ferranti
            as a consultant in the development of their commercialised machine,
            the Ferranti Mark 1. He continued to be paid consultancy fees by
            Ferranti until his death.
